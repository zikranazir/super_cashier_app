2. Defines Class Transaction()
![initclass](src/initclass.png)
The above code defines a class called Transaction which contains a constructor method called init(). This constructor method initializes the class with two properties, items and total_price. The items property is defined as an empty list and total_price is set to zero. This class is designed to represent a transaction, and the constructor method initializes the transaction by creating an empty list for the items and setting the total price to zero.

3. Method add_item()
![alt](/src/additem.png)
The code above defines a method called 'add_item' within a class that is used to add an item to a transaction. This method takes a tuple consisting of the name, quantity, and price of the item to be added. The method then appends this tuple to the list of items in the transaction and calculates the total price by multiplying the quantity of the item with its price and adding it to the total price attribute of the transaction object. Finally, the method returns None as it doesn't have a return statement.
   
4. Method check_item()
